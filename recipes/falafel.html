    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (15-oz.) can chickpeas, drained</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>1 shallot, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>2 tbsp. freshly chopped parsley</li>
        <li>1 tsp. ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 tsp. ground coriander</li>
        <li>3 tbsp. all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil, for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a food processor fitted with a metal blade, combine chickpeas, garlic, shallot, parsley, cumin, coriander, and flour and season with salt and pepper. Pulse until mixture is coarse and mealy—do not over blend!</li>
        <li>Form mixture into falafel balls about 2" in diameter, squeezing to compact. Transfer to chill in the refrigerator while oil heats.</li>
        <li>In a pot, heat 1” vegetable oil until a drop of water added to the oil sizzles and pops.</li>
        <li>Fry falafels until golden, then transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and season immediately with salt.</li>
        <li>To make yogurt sauce: In a medium bowl, whisk together yogurt, lemon juice, oil, and dill. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>To make tahini sauce: In a medium bowl, whisk together tahini, garlic, lemon juice, and warm water. Season with salt.</li>
        <li>Serve falafels in pita with lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumber and drizzle with either sauce.</li>
    </ol>
